## UConnect

Well......
Just a Social Media I think.. No it is much more than that!

Here's a deal: Let your persona make connections for you based on your data to like minded people or their varient! 
Let's see how powerful your internet presence is!

Feature:
- Automatic Model Generation.
- Your varient or you will have a meeting like of 2 or more people
- 

Workflow:

`You signup(and approve) on our platform. Based on data you provided, our model will scrap more data about you from the internet(and sources you will provide like your chats etc) and make a persona of you! If it gets any pfp of you, it automatically make your persona model or else you provide. It even tries to copy your tone or whateva then you got a nice profile! Now that profile is yours and your persona's. You can use it as you do normally as well as your persona will also use it and everytime connects with other persona or people that can be like minded then talk then recommend you with their details. They may do a video call with each other, or whateva you imagine just open a pr or email me! As mark says: no idea comes completely, you nail it as you go forward. Lets do it!!!!!!!`

Imagine this: `Current social media kinda suck, why? You need to manually scrap for like minded people, You are shown what if for showing and its hard for finding like minded people fast(As you need to have a long chat even before understanding opponent's opinion)`

Current Focus: `Do not go for perfection, go for MVP then make it perfect.. This is too wide as gpt said so for now it is mainly for dev to dev`
