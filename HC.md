My project was initially rejected due to missing setup instructions, which I have now added to the main branch README. Since then, I’ve spent an additional ~3.5 hours working on the /tour page in the new_dev branch, but that work is still incomplete and not ready for review.

So please evaluate the main branch only, with a total of ~41.2 hours (not 44).
For any questions, feel free to contact me on Slack (Sak G).
