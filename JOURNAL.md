- So I have started Journaling to make it easy for team to review the project(or harder lol)


## Dec 9: ~3h 25m. Made a combile component and a Mobile model but ran after a problem (It is not precise as its 10 today)
- ~1h Blender: Modeling low poly mobile for tour page.
- ~1h 10min Vs code: Loaded the glb file in a component and did some test. Also made VideoCube to test videoTexture for 1st time.
- ~35m blender: So after loading and applying VideoTexture, the screen got disappeared, I shared the issue in forum and I was said to do UV mapping, I tried learning and implementing but nothing happens. (maybe I missed something?)
- ~40m Vs code: So I though what if it is any syntax error in r3f so made a directory other('test' now) and started testing in raw threejs..

## Dec 10: ~7h 21m. Added texture in the mobile screen. Floating Effect. Init Raycasting
- ~18m Vs code: So I made this JOURNAL.md in 18 min :)
- (18m to 56m) = ~38m Vs code: Making new branches, adding setup in main etc etc stuff
- (56m to 2h 52m) = ~1hr 56m Vs code: Finally solved the texture problem
- (2h 52m to 4h 35m) = ~1h 43m vs code and blender: Rotated the texture and solved the orientation problem.
- (4h 35m to 7h 21m) = ~2h 36m vs code: Floating effect, playing video and looking for raycasting(rotate on hover effect)

## Dec 11: ~3h 7m. Raycasting, Gsap intigration in process
- (0m to 1h8m): 1h 6m Vs code: Raycasting and camera position changing for cursor effect.
- Rest: Trying GSAP to work with my 3d models

## Dec 12: ~Xh Ym. ____________________________________________
